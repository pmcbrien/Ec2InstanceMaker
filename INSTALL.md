## License and Disclaimer Information

Please refer to the LICENSE and DISCLAIMER.md documents included with this Open Source software for the specific terms and conditions that govern its use.

## Introduction

Ec2InstanceMaker is Open Source software that simplifies the automation
of creating, deleting, and administering cloud computing server and storage 
resources through an easy-to-use command line interface.  It can also be used
as a teaching tool for those who wish to dive deep into cloud automation and
to learn more about the AWS ecosystem.

This toolkit is currently supported on local OSX and Linux environments and
EC2 instances spawned with the GenericEc2InstancePolicy.json template.  In
theory, it can also be used on Windows machines that have Python and an
appropriately configured Bash-Cygwin environment, but this method has not been
tested and will **not** be supported.

## Creating an Installation Environment on OSX

This section provides guidance for launching new EC2 instances directly from
OSX.  Please be forewarned that this method requires installing external tools
including Homebrew which may createe other unforeseen problems with your local
environment.

* Clone the Ec2InstanceMaker toolkit into your local ~/src directory:
```
$ mkdir ~/src
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/rmarable/Ec2InstanceMaker.git
```

* Install the Command Line Tools for Xcode:
```
$ sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /
```

* Install Homebrew:
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

* Use Homebrew to install some other critical applications:
```
$ brew install ansible autoconf automake gcc jq libtool make python readline
```

* Configure the AWS CLI according to the guidelines provided in the AWS public
documentation:

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html

* Install and activate a virtual Python 3.x environment using virtualenv or pyenv.  Anything above version 3.6 should work fine.  Please visit these links for more details on configuring and using Python virtual environments:
  * https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/
  * https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/

pyenv is preferred by the author but it doesn't provide a prompt that will
display the current Python version like virtualenv does without performing
some additional steps.  Please follow the installation guidelines provided
here: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation

Please be **very** careful or you may inadvertedly damage your local Python
environment:
```
$ brew install pyenv
$ brew install pyenv-virtualenv
$ pyenv install 3.7.4
```

If the Python build fails, reinstall the Xcode CLT:
```
$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
$ xcode-select --install
$ pyenv install 3.7.4 -v
$ python â€”version
3.7.4
```

Create and activate a virtual Python environment to support Ec2InstanceMaker:
```
$ pyenv virtualenv ec2instancemaker
$ pyenv activate ec2instancemaker
```

If you prefer using virtualenv, install it using pip, taking careful note **not** to deploy into the Ec2InstanceMaker source folder to keep your source tree clean and organized:
```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv --version
16.7.5
$ mkdir -p ~/src/ec2instancemaker
$ virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3.7 ~/src/ec2instancemaker
$ export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3.7
$ source ~/src/ec2instancemaker/bin/activate
```

* Install the required Python libraries into the Python virtual environment
using the included requirements.txt files:
```
$ cd ~/src/Ec2InstanceMaker
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd ~
```

* You are now ready to build EC2 instances on OSX.  Please consult README.md and EXAMPLE_USE_CASES.md for more detailed information on leveraging this toolkit.

## Creating an Installation Environment on Linux (local or EC2)

The linux-ec2-setup.sh script can be used to set up the Ec2InstanceMaker operating environment on EC2 instances, virtual machines, or physical servers running CentOS, Amazon Linux, or Ubuntu.  Instances created with Ec2InstanceMaker can also be used to spawn additional children.

After building a fresh EC2 instance, clone the repository to a local $SRC_DIR run the installer:
```
$ mkdir -p ~/src && cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/rmarable/Ec2InstanceMaker.git
$ cd src/Ec2InstanceMaker
$ ./linux-ec2-setup.sh
```

Please note that the default IAM permissions granted to Ec2InstanceMaker-spawned instances are *NOT* sufficient to create child instances.  Please see the "Note to DevOps Teams" section in the README for additional guidance.

## About make-instance.py

To view all available options for make-instance.py:
```
$ cd ~/src/Ec2InstanceMaker
$ ./make-instance.py --help
```

## Launching Instances Using Docker

Ec2InstanceMaker supports launching new EC2 instances from a Docker container.
Some users may prefer this method over using a "jumphost" for launching child
instances.

* Install Docker by following the guidelines outlined here:

https://docs.docker.com/install/ 

* Create $SRC_DIR (suggested: `~/src`):
`$ mkdir -p $SRC_DIR`

* Clone the Ec2InstanceMaker repository into $SRC_DIR.
```
$ cd $SRC_DIR
$ git clone https://github.com/rmarable/Ec2InstanceMaker.git
$ cd Ec2InstanceMaker
```

* If needed, run `aws configure`.

* Edit `Dockerfile` and either paste your AWS credentials where indicated or use
environment variables as suggested in the AWS public documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html

* Build the container, launch it interactively, and start building instances:
```
$ docker build -t ec2instancemaker .
$ docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash ec2instancemaker:latest -i
<nav># pwd
/Ec2InstanceMaker
<nav># ./make-instance.py -h
```

## Example Use Cases

Please review these common use cases that this tool can help address.  More 
details are provided in the EXAMPLE_USE-CASES.md document.

### Example: Building a Single Linux Instance 

This example builds a single t2.micro development instance called "dev01"
running Amazon Linux 2 with a 20 GB gp2 EBS root volume using the default
IAM role which grants "general" S3 and EC2 permissions in us-east-1c.  The
instance is owned by the computational biology team ("compbio") and used by
project "XRV-243":
```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-east-1c -N dev01 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com -B alinux2 --ebs_root_volume_size=20 --instance_owner_department=compbio --project_id="XRV-243"
```

Building the same instance using Spot (which can achieve up to 90% savings over
ondemand pricing):
```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-east-1c -N dev01 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com -B alinux2 --ebs_root_volume_size=20 --instance_owner_department=compbio --project_id="XRV-243" --request_type=spot
```

### Example: Building a Single Windows Instance 

This example builds a single t2a.micro development instance called "dev001"
running Windows Server 2019 with a 30 GB gp2 EBS root volume using the default
IAM role which grants "general" S3 and EC2 permissions in us-west-2b.  The
instance is owned by the computational chemistry team ("compchem") and is not
used by any active project:
```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-west-2b -N dev001 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com -B windows2019 --instance_owner_department=compchem
```

Again, building this same instance using Spot (which can achieve up to 90%
savings over ondemand pricing):
```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-west-2b -N dev001 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com -B windows2019 --instance_owner_department=compchem --request_type=spot
```

### Example: Building Multiple Spot Instances

This example builds a family of five t3.micro test instances called "fam01"
running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, each with a 10 GB gp2 EBS root volume using the
default IAM role in eu-central-1a.  These instances are owned by the HPC team:
```
$ ./make-instance.py -A eu-central-1a -N fam01 -B ubuntu1804 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com --ebs_root_volume_size=10 --instance_owner_department=hpc --request_type=spot --instance_type=t3.micro -C 5
```

Building the same instance family using Spot:
```
$ ./make-instance.py -A eu-central-1a -N fam01 -B ubuntu1804 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com --ebs_root_volume_size=10 --instance_owner_department=hpc --request_type=spot --instance_type=t3.micro -C 5 --request_type=spot
```

Building this instance family using Spot and Windows:
```
$ ./make-instance.py -A eu-central-1a -N fam01 -B windows2019 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com --ebs_root_volume_size=10 --instance_owner_department=hpc --request_type=spot --instance_type=t3.micro -C 5
```

### Example: Accessing an Instance 

Ec2InstanceMaker provides an easy mechanism to access individual instances or
specific members of a particular instance family over SSH.  Following every 
build, Ec2InstanceMaker will dump access and deletion information to the
console for user convenience.  For mulitple instance "families," a selection
menu for each instance will be provided.  The operator can also provide the 
index of the instance to avoid parsing the menu.  This is also useful for 
scripting actions against instance families created by this tool.

To access the single instance "dev01" created above:
```
$ ./access_instance.py -N dev01

## Deactivating the virtual Python environment

If you are using a virtual Python environment to work with Ec2InstanceMaker,
it is a good practice to disable it when you are finished with your instance
maintenance activities.

For pyenv:
```
$ pyenv deactivate
```

For virtualenv:
```
$ deactivate
```

Please consult README.md for additional information on how to use the
make-instance.py script.
