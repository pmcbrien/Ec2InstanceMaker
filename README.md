## About Ec2InstanceMaker

Ec2InstanceMaker is an Open Source command line wrapper toolkit that eases the
automation, creation, and destruction of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
instance fleets that can optionally be attached to Elastic File System (EFS)
or FSx for Lustre storage resources.  This tool is designed to enable anyone
to leverage cloud computing and storage resources at scale without requiring
deep infrastructure knowledge or extensive experience with the AWS stack.

You can find more information about EC2, EC2 Spot, EFS, and FSx for Lustre by
visiting:

* https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
* https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/
* https://aws.amazon.com/efs/
* https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/

Ec2InstanceMaker makes extensive use of Ansible, the Amazon Web Services SDK
for Python (boto3), Terraform, and jq.  It can be launched from a Docker
container, local OSX or Linux environments, or from an existing EC2 instance.
You can find more information about these tools by visiting:

* Ansible: https://www.ansible.com/
* Boto3: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html
* Docker: https://docs.docker.com/
* Terraform: https://www.terraform.io/
* jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

Ec2InstanceMaker also requires Python 3.6 (or greater) and a functional Bash
shell environment.  As noted above, this tool can be run locally on OSX or
Linux, on an existing EC2 Linux instance, from a Docker container, or from an
EC2 instance spawned from a previous invocation of Ec2InstanceMaker.  Please
refer to the "Installing Ec2InstanceMaker" section for detailed guidance on
how to properly configure your environment.

Running Ec2InstanceMaker locally on a Windows machine is **not** supported,
although it should work in theory with appropriately configured Python and
Bash-Cygwin environments.

## Ec2InstanceMaker Features

Ec2InstanceMaker provides the following features through its command line
interface:

* Installation of multiple operating systems on EC2 instances:
  * Amazon Linux
  * Amazon Linux 2
  * CentOS 6
  * CentOS 7
  * Ubuntu 14.04LTS
  * Ubuntu 16.04LTS
  * Ubuntu 18.04LTS
  * Windows Server 2019

    Redhat, OpenSuse, and SLES may be supported in future releases.

* Error checking to ensure that the selected operating system and EC2 instance
type are compatible.

* Administrative control over the allowed EC2 instance types that can be deployed.

* Custom AMI support to enable deployment of standardized cloud computing environments.  Please see "Working with Custom AMIs" below for more details on how to leverage these options which include:
  * Spawning of new instances from previously built user-supplied "custom AMIs."
  * Creation of new "golden images" using EC2 instances spawned from Ec2InstanceMaker as the source.
  * Easy inclusion of user customization scripts within the Ec2InstanceMaker provisioning process.
  * Optional construction of "golden images" with encrypted root EBS volumes.
  * Incorporation into existing DevOps CI/CD piplines.

* Spawning EC2 instances from a Docker container.

* Multiple instances with identical configurations built at the same time a.k.a. "instance families."

* Command line designation of dev, test, stage, and prod operating levels. 

* Deployment of EC2 Spot instances with a adjustable price buffer to help
prevent terminations caused by Spot market fluctuations.

* Deployment of instance families into EC2 placement groups utilizing the
"cluster" strategy.

* Variable EBS root volume sizes up to 16 TB.

* Automatic application of EBS optimization for supported instance types.

* Attachment of provisioned IOPS, throughput optizimed, and general purpose
(gp2) SSD EBS volumes during the instance creation process.

* Creation of EFS file systems that share the instance lifecycle and tags.
  * Provisioned EFS throughput is NOT supported by this toolkit; please use Lustre if your use cases require high throughput or large IOPS beyond what "maxIO" or "burst mode" can provide.

* Command line option to enable encryption of EFS at rest and in flight.

* Create of FSx for Lustre file systems that share the instance(s) lifecycle
and tags.  Hydration to and from an S3 bucket is also supported.

* Selective disabling of Intel HyperThreading.

* Custom i.e. user-provided EC2 security groups.

* Custom i.e. user-provided IAM instance profiles that can be created from user-supplied JSON policy documents or pre-existing IAM roles.  Guidance for how to communicate with your local DevOps team to get their support with deployment of tthe aforementioned policy documents is also provided in the "Note to DevOps Teams" section below.

* Control of the IAM namespace used by roles, instance profiles, and policies
through the "iam_name_prefix" parameter.  If this switch is not set, all IAM
entitities default to using "Ec2InstanceMaker" as the prefix.  This makes it
easier for DevOps teams to incorporate Ec2InstanceMaker into architectures that
are based on users assuming predefined roles to perform activities in the AWS
environment.

* Email notifications via SNS whenever an instance is created or deleted.

* Identification of the instance owner, email address, and department using
an easily extendable tagging framework.  The instance can also be associated
with a specific project identification tag.  The department tagging mechanism
is easily customizable to meet your use case.

* Additional instance customization hooks using EC2 instance userdata or
post-installation shell scripts.  Please see the "Instance Customization" 
section for more details.

* Custom scripting to automate deletion the instance or all members of the
instance family at once.

* Single-command SSH access to Linux instances.  If multiple instances were
created together, an easy-to-use menu is provided for the user to select the
instance of interest.

* For Windows instances, mapping of IP addresses to decrypted Administrator
passwords in an easy-to-parse table dumped to the console.  This information
can be pasted into RDC for easy access.

* Operability in Turbot environnments.  Please visit https://www.turbot.com for more information.

* Restriction of attaching public IP addresses for environments that require additional security.

* Selection of a specific VPC.  Note that the VPC *must* be named or Terraform will fail.

## Installation Instructions for the Impatient

These instructions are provided for the impatient and/or lazy.

* Install Homebrew (if using OSX).

* Install and configure the AWS CLI.

* Install Terraform.

* Install Ansible.

* Install jq.

* Create and enable a virtual Python-3.7.x environment.

* Install the Python libraries in Ec2InstanceMaker/requirements.txt into the
freshly created virtual Python environment.

* Build away!

**It is strongly suggested that the reader carefully review the installation documentation (INSTALL.md) to avoid potentially costly and time-consuming mistakes.** 

## Note to DevOps Teams

As noted above, Ec2InstanceMaker is intended to reduce the administrative burden required for DevOps teams to support the diverse compute and storage needs of their stakeholders; conversely, it can empower scientists, engineers, statisticians, and analysts to compute at scale without needing to get assistnace from their Devops team.

* **Ec2InstanceMaker supports the use of private IP addresses for environments that require enhanced security.**
  * Deployment of public IP addresses can be disabled by setting `--public_ip=false`.
  * Please note that if this feature is invoked within a compute environment that does not live in the target VPC, the provisioning process will fail with a "connection refused" error:
`Error: timeout - last error: dial tcp 172.31.32.161:22: connect: connection refused`
  * A more descriptive error will be returned in a future release.

* **Ec2InstanceMaker can deploy into any active VPC that is named.**

* **Ec2InstanceMaker does not make any changes to the existing networking environment already present in the operator's AWS account.**
  * These tools do not create new VPCs, subnets, Internet or NAT gateways, routes, or Transit Gateways.
  * They do not modify Route53 configurations, change default routes, or otherwise impact or deploy any infrastructure that is not explicitly documented or easily inferred by reviewing the code.

* **Ec2InstanceMaker creates generic IAM roles, policies, and instance templates that are individualized as much as possible for each instance or instance family.  By default, Ec2InstanceMaker-spawned instances cannot spwan children.**
  * These JSON templates are located in the templates/ subdirectory and contain all required IAM permissions to work with the AWS services listed below:
    * EC2
    * AutoScaling
    * S3
    * SQS
    * SNS
  * If you run into permissions problems building instances or provisioning storage resources, it's usually because of an IAM issue.  When speaking with your DevOps professionals, the following options are suggested:
    * Set `--iam_json_policy=ExtendedEc2InstancePolicy.json` to use the included JSON policy document which permits children instances to be spawned.
    * Work with your DevOps team to construct a custom IAM role that provides appropriate permissions for your environment, then include it by setting `--iam_role=$ROLE_NAME` when invoking `make-instance.py.`  Please refer to the EXAMPLE_USE_CASES document for additional guidance.
  * DevOps teams should also be aware that additional granular control over the IAM namespace can be realized by setting `--iam_name_prefix` to a chosen value.  This makes it eaiser to incorporate Ec2InstanceMaker into environments that perfer to have users assume a set of standard roles to perform tasks in the AWS environment.

For example:
```
$ ./make-instance.py -N dev01 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com -A us-west-2b --iam_name_prefix=MyEc2IamPrefix
```

This command will create an EC2 instance role, instance profile, and policy prepended with MyEc2IamPrefix.  The user can only create, delete, or modify IAM entities that are prepended with "MyEc2IamPrefix."

## Using Ec2InstanceMaker

Ec2InstanceMaker is a collection of scripts and user-configurable templates.

**Scripts.** Please see below for more details on how the scripts are used.
* make-instance.py
* access-instance.py
* kill-instance.$INSTANCE_NAME.py

**Templates**.  Ec2InstanceMaker provides some generic templates that can be
customized to permit more granular control over the IAM EC2 instance policy
that is used to create the instance profiles that are created by the toolkit.

  * **MinimalEc2InstancePolicy.json** is a bare-bones template that allows only
EC2 and S3 API calls.
  * **GenericEc2InstancePolicy.json** provides enough permissions for an EC2
"jumphost" spawned by make-instance.py to in turn create additional instances.
In addition to allowing EC2 and S3, it also permits maintenance of EFS and FSx
for Lustre file systems, SQS queues, SNS topic administration, IAM role and
instance profile maintenance, and access to SSM.  However, please note that
this template does *NOT* provide adequate permissions for instances built with
Ec2InstanceMzker to spwan children of their own.
  * **ExtendedEc2InstancePolicy.json** is equivalent to `GenericEc2InstancePolicy.json` permissions for an EC2 except that it grants Ec2InstanceMaker-spawned
instances appropriate permissions to spawn children.
  * **Ec2AdminInstancePolicy.json** is provides the EC2 instance profile with
full adminstrator rights over the AWS account in question.  *Use this policy
judiciously!*
  * **build_instance.j2** permits the operator to leverage Terraform's
post-install hook to perform further configuration of EC2 instances using a
shell script.
  * **instance_userdata.j2** will allow the operator to leverage EC2 instance
userdata to perform additional configuration.  Please reference:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-add-user-data

### Building Instances

The minimum required arguments are the Availability Zone, the instance owner's
username and email address, and the instance name.  All other parameters will
fall back to the default of a single ondemand t2.micro instance running Amazon
Linux 2 with an 8 GB EBS gp2 unencrypted volume as the root device, using the
supplied JSON policy document to generate an IAM instance profile providing
EC2 and S3 access:

```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-east-2a -N ec2-testinstance01 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com
```

To build a Windows instance using (mostly) default values:

```
./make-instance.py -N dev01 -O rmarable -E rmarable@amazon.com -A us-east-1b -I t3a.micro -B windows2019
```

If the user provides illegal parameter values or if any of the required AWS
resources fail to deploy, the script will loudly echo an appropriate error 
before aborting.  In the example below, the user attempts to build an EBS root
device that is larger than 16 TB:

```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-east-2a -N ec2-testinstance01 -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com --ebs_root_volume_size=16049311

Performing parameter validation...

Selected EC2 instance type: t2.micro
** WARNING **
t2.micro does not support EBS optimization!
Disabling ebs_optimization for: ec2-testinstance01

** ERROR **
Maximum allowed EBS volume size is 16 TB (16000 GB)!

Please resolve this error and retry the instance build.
Aborting...
```

### Accessing Instances

**access-instance.py** provides an easy mechanism for making SSH connections
to multiple EC2 Linux instances.  When working with Windows EC2 instances,
this script will provide the decrypted Administrator password and IP address
which can then be pasted into a Remote Desktop Client within an easy-to-parse
table.

For a single Linux instance:

```
$ ./access_instance.py -N dev01
Last login: Thu Jun 13 03:55:11 2019 from 72-21-196-65.amazon.com

       __|  __|_  )

      ___|\___|___|

https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-6-21 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 3.215.135.101 closed.

Reconnect to dev01 by running this command:

$ ./access_instance.py -N dev01
```

For a single Windows instance:

```
Access the new instance via Windows Remote Desktop with this information:

+---------------+---------------+----------------------------------+
| Instance Name |   IP Address  |      Adminstrator Password       |
+---------------+---------------+----------------------------------+

+---------------+---------------+----------------------------------+

Reprint this table:
$ ./access-instance.py -N dev01
```

When working with Linux instance families, `access_instance.py` provides an
interactive menu allowing the user to select the specific instance of interest:

```
$ ./access_instance.py -N fam01

+------+---------------+----------------+
| Item | Instance Name |   IP Address   |
+------+---------------+----------------+
|  1   |    fam01-0    | 18.204.42.129  |

The "-m" switch can be used to access a specific instance as it is listed 
in the table.  This enables access_instance.py to be used for other automated
tasks.

`$ ./access_instance.py -N fam01 -m 3`

When working with multiple Windows instances, a menu displaying the decrypted
Administrator password and IP address of each instance is dumped to the 
console.  This data can be pasted into an RDC client to access the instance
of choice:

```
$ ./access_instance.py -N dev01

### Destroying Instances

**kill-instance.$INSTANCE_NAME.sh** is a personalized script designed to 
terminate specific EC2 instances, EC2 security groups, IAM entities, and any
associated storage resources that were tagged with the `instance_serial_nunber.`
It is generated by make-instance.py and will delete itself when all tagged 
instances and resources are terminated.

To invoke:

```
$ ./kill-instance.dev01.sh

EC2 instance "dev01" is marked for termination.

## Instance Customization

The basic post-installation shell script performs a systems package update and
inserts a 45-second keep-alive interval to prevent SSH logouts from affecting
any ongoing interactive instance activity.

The instance userdata template disables Intel HyperThreading if `--enable_hyperthreading=false` and modifies the root volume on CentOS 6 instances so it can be expanded up to 16 TB without user intervention.

Ec2InstanceMaker also permits additional user customization by simply pasting the desired commands into `templates/custom_user_script.j2` beneath the obvious comment:

```
########################################################
## Paste your custom script actions below this comment #
########################################################
```

This provides operators and DevOps professionals with a powerful mechanism for quickly building and distributing "golden" AMI images that can be widely distributed throughout an enterprise, or for customized images that can be specifically tailored by individuals or teams.  Please see "Working with Custom AMIs" and "Building New AMIs with the build-ami Script" for additional details.

Please note that additional customization of Windows instances can only be performed through the userdata template (templates/instance_userdata.j2).

Support for joining a Windows Active Directory domain and mounting FSx for Windows storage will be provided in a future release.  Support for PowerShell scripts may also be provided in subsequent releases.

## Using EFS

EFS support can be enabled by setting `--enable_efs=true` when the instance is
first constructed: 

```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-east-1a -O rmarable -E rmarable@amazon.com -N dev01 --request_type=spot --count=3 --enable_efs=true
```

This will create a new EFS file system that shares tags and its lifecycle with
instance family "dev01."

Support for "general purpose" and "maximum IO" modes can be selected through
the efs_performance_mode switch:

```
  --efs_performance_mode {generalPurpose,maxIO}
                        select the EFS performance mode (default =
                        generalPurpose)
```

To encrypt EFS traffic at rest and in flight, set `efs_encryption=true`.  Note
that encryption in transit is not supported under centos6 or ubuntu1404.

Building an EFS file system will add an extra three minutes to the creation
process time.

## Using FSx for Lustre

To add an FSx for Lustre file system that shares both the instance tag collection and lifecycle, set `enable_fsx=true` when the instance is first created.  The example below will attach a 1,200 GB Lustre file system mounted at /fsx to a new Amazon Linux 2 instance:

```
$ ./make-instance.py -A us-east-1a -O rmarable -E rmarable@amazon.com -N dev01 --count=3 --request_type=spot --enable_fsx=true
```

The size of the file system is controlled with the `fsx_size` flag.  Lustre file
systems must use multiples of 1,200 GB or an error will be returned.  Please refer to the product announcement: https://amzn.to/2m25H5j

Hydration of an FSX file system from an S3 bucket is supported by setting 
`enable_fsx_hydration=true`, designating an existing S3 bucket (`fsx_s3_bucket`)
and path (`fsx_s3_path`), and optionally choosing a "chunk" size (`fsx_chunk_size`).  The bucket and path, if provided, must exist or an error will be returned.

This example will create a 1.2 TB Lustre file system that will hydrate to and
from s3://rmarable-hydration-test/import mounted at /fsx on an Amazon Linux 2
spot instance family called "dev01."  

```
./make-instance.py -A us-east-1a -O rmarable -E rmarable@amazon.com -N dev01 --count=3 --request_type=spot --enable_fsx=true --fsx_s3_bucket=rmarable-hydration-test --fsx_s3_path=import --enable_fsx_hydration=true
```

Please note that the size of all Lustre file systems must be provisioned in
multples of 1,200 TB.  The make-instance.py script will return an error if
this step is ignored.

To faciliate pushing data in an out of the bucket from Lustre, please use the
following shell scripts which will be automatically created and stored in 
/usr/local/bin on all instance family members:

Import S3 from Lustre: this script will push data from S3 into the FSx layer
with a transfer rate that is 1/2 that of the Luster file system:
`$ /usr/local/bin/import-s3-to-lustre.sh`

Export Lustre to S3: this script will push data from the FSx layer into S3:
`$ /usr/local/bin/export-lustre-to-s3.sh`

Check export status: this script will permit you to track the progress of an
export Lustre-to-S3 tasks:
`$ /usr/local/bin/check-lustre-export-progress.sh`

For more information on Lustre hydration to and from S3, please refer to the
AWS public documentation on using FSx with durable data repositories:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/fsx-data-repositories.html

Support for attaching FSx for Windows file systems to EC2 instances running
Windows Server 2019 may be provided in a future release.

## EC2 Placement Groups

Ec2InstanceMaker supports the use of EC2 placement groups by setting
`--enable_placement_group=true`.  The strategies supported currently are
"cluster' and "spread."  Future releases will support "partition" placement
groups with additional control over the number of allowed partitions through
command line switches.

The placement group will be named "ec2pg-$INSTANCE_SERIAL_NUMBER" and is tied
to the instance life cycle.

The script will abort if the operator attempts to place a single instance into
a placement group.

## Working with Custom AMIs ##

Ec2InstanceMaker supports building new instances from custom AMIs by using the `--custom_ami` switch.  If the custom_ami is not found, the script will return an error.

## Launching Instances Using Docker

Ec2InstanceMaker supports launching new EC2 instances from a Docker container.

Please refer to "Launching Instances Using Docker" in the INSTALL document.

## Building New AMIs Using the build-ami Script ##

Ec2InstanceMaker provides a customized build script for each instance_serial_number which permits the operator to create and register a new AMI image.  By including custom code in the `build-instance.j2` template, users now have a powerful mechanism for quickly customizing AMIs without requiring DevOps assistance.  Conversely, DevOps professionals now have a means to disseminate curated "golden" AMIs throughout their environment.

To build a new AMI:
```
$ ./build-ami.$INSTANCE_NAME.sh
```

By default, any AMI created by this script will be preserved after the instance (or instance family) is terminated.

To modify this behavior, the instance(s) must be built by setting `preserve_ami=false` like this:
```
./make-instance.py -O rmarable -E rodney.marable@gmail.com -N dev01 -A us-east-1a --preserve_ami=false
```

This is *not* a recommended best practice and should only be enabled when testing.

## Troubleshooting

* Python version 3.6 or greater is required by this software.  Additionally,
you must install the required libraries in requirements.txt.  If any of these
components are missing, you will observe missing Python module errors:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named boto3'
```

* Ansible and Terraform must also be present in order for the scripts in this
toolkit to operate as expected.  If either of these applications are missing
from the installing user's path, make-instance.py will return an "application
is missing" error:

```
$ ./make-instance.py -N dev01 -O rmarable -E rmarable@amazon.com -A us-east-1b -I t3.micro -C 3 --request_type=spot

** ERROR **
Terraform is missing! Please visit: https://www.terraform.io/downloads

Please resolve this error and retry the instance build.
Aborting...
```

* CentOS and Ubuntu require subscribing to the appropriate operating system
channel in the AWS Marketplace:

```
Error: Error launching source instance: OptInRequired: In order to use this AWS Marketplace product you need to accept terms and subscribe. To do so please visit https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=a1rz1wghrw6x9gn14lyded00r
```

If you observe this error while attempting to build an EC2 instance, please
follow the guidelines provided in the message output to subscribe to the OS 
channel through the AWS Marketplace.

* Ec2InstanceMaker supports EBS encryption but does not yet provide a mechanism
for building and attaching multiple EBS volumes to an EC2 instance during the
installation process, which would subsequently be encrypted when
`--enable_ebs_encryption=true`.  This feature will be provided in a future
release.

* Encryption of root volumes during the instance installation process is now
supported by Terraform.  When the instance is finished building, build a new encrypted AMI with the included `build-ami` script using the symlink in the top-level SRC tree.
  * Note the resulting AMI ID value and use it to launch subsequent instances with "--custom_ami=$AMI_ID".

You can also enable EBS encryption by default for all instances in the account by reviewing this link to the AWS public documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default

Please be advised that this is a per-Region setting that can't be disabled on
a per-volume or snapshot basis.  Furthermore, you will not be able to launch
instances that do not support encryption within the region in question.  This
link on the AWS public documentation summarizes the instances that can be
launched within the region in question for that account:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances

* Please be advised that EFS encryption in transit is **not** supported for
CentOS 6 or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

  * centos6 ships with openssl-1.0.1e-57, which is too old to support to support
TLS with EFS.  There are no officially supported openssl packages beyond this
version.

  * ubuntu1404 does not seem to support building the native Debian package of
amazon-efs-utils.

  * EFS encryption in transit for these operating systems may be provided in a 
subsequent feature release.

* If the instance(s) cannot be built due to a lack of spot capacity, Terraform
will return a "capacity-not-available" error.  To resolve this, try increasing
the spot_buffer or using ondemand instead.
